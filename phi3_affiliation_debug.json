Provide exact figures where available. \n2. Disregard information about other climate change effects such as temperature rise, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss unless they directly relate to sea-level projections or impacts on coastal communities in Southeast Asia.\n3. Omit any historical context of the research study (e.g., when it was conducted) but include details about future predictions based on current trends as presented within the article's findings section, specifically for 2050 and beyond.\n4. Exclude all references to individual authors or institutions involved in conducting the research unless their contribution directly pertains to sea-level rise data specificity (e.g., unique measurement techniques).\n5. Do not include any direct quotes from experts; instead, paraphrase key findings related to projected impacts on coastal infrastructure and populations within Southeast Asia due to rising seas by 2050 or later.\n6. Present the information in a structured summary format that categorizes data into 'Current State', 'Projected Trends for 2050+', and 'Impact on Coastal Communities'.
